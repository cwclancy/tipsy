# Project 1 - Tipsy

Tipsy is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Connor Clancy

Time spent: 4.5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [y] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [n] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [y] UI animations
* [n] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [n] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [n] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

- added capability for user to split the bill easily between 1 and 5 people
- allows user to clear entry, so if a mistype occurs it is easy to restart

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

First time using objective C so some issues just gettting used to syntax and 
getting used to the Xcode IDE, more complicated than what I am used to
but obviously very powerful.
